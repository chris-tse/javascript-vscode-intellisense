# JavaScript VSCode Intellisense Boilerplate

This project is a simple boilerplate for enabling intellisense when working on different files that don't import functions from other files (such as when working on vanilla JS or JQuery).

This repo has two branches showcasing two different methods:

1. Using `/// <reference path="">` method
2. Using a `jsconfig.json` file
